== httpr ==
simple http reverse proxy

=== overview ===
It currently only support http protocol.
It is not very efficient, I guess.
But it works.
Please make it better with your pull request.

=== PORTMAP ===
To use httpr, please make PORTMAP file in same directory that httpr will run.

Each line of the file should be `prefix port` format.
Default `_ port` line should always exist.

Following is the example.
`
_ 8080
hello 8081
hi 8082
here 8083
`

When the org name is "example.org", It will binding to...

example.org -> localhost:8080
www.example.org -> localhost:8080
{any_prefix}.example.org -> localhost:8080

hello.example.org -> localhost:8081
hi.example.org -> localhost:8082
here.example.org -> localhost:8083

=== run ===
Install Go.
Then use `go get` and `go install`.
